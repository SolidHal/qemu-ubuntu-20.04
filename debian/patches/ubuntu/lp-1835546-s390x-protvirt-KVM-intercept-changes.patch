Subject: [PATCH] s390x: protvirt: KVM intercept changes

Protected VMs no longer intercept with code 4 for an instruction
interception. Instead they have codes 104 and 108 for protected
instruction interception and protected instruction notification
respectively.

The 104 mirrors the 4 interception.

The 108 is a notification interception to let KVM and QEMU know that
something changed and we need to update tracking information or
perform specific tasks. It's currently taken for the following
instructions:

* spx (To inform about the changed prefix location)
* sclp (On incorrect SCCB values, so we can inject a IRQ)
* sigp (All but "stop and store status")
* diag308 (Subcodes 0/1)

Of these exits only sclp errors, state changing sigps and diag308 will
reach QEMU. QEMU will do its parts of the job, while the ultravisor
has done the instruction part of the job.
