Just a small list of things not to forget for any new (upstream) release:

* Make sure it works with the BIOS files in testing or otherwise raise the
  dependency versions

* If adding support for a new (host, not guest) arch:
  Make sure to add it to the gpm Build-Dep (if that arch has gpm of course)
  until Bug#267174 is solved.
