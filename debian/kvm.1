.SH NAME
kvm \- obsolete wrapper for qemu-system-x86_64
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B kvm
wrapper script is used to provide compatibility with old
qemu\-kvm package which has been merged into qemu as of
version 1.3.
.P
The script prints a warning on stderr and executes
.RS
.B qemu\-system\-x86_64 -machine accel:kvm,tcg
.RE
passing all other command-line arguments to qemu binary.
This means more or less the same thing as the old kvm
binary provided: to run qemu in kvm mode if it is available,
and switch to emulator mode (tcg) if not.
.P
For new installs it is advisable to use
.RS
.B qemu\-system\-x86_64 \-enable\-kvm
.RE
instead, -- this will fail if kvm mode is not available
instead of falling back to use a very slow emulation mode.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR qemu (1).
