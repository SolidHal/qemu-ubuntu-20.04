qemu for Debian
---------------

There's a rough make_debian_root.sh which uses debootstrap to create a
fresh Debian installation inside an image suitable for qemu.  The
debootstrap --exclude args are particularly vulnerable to breakage:
try removing them if it doesn't work.  You'll need to run it as root.
