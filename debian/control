Description: fast processor emulator
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
 ARM, CRIS, i386, M68k (ColdFire), MIPS, PowerPC, SH4, SPARc and x86-64 
 emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves reasonable speed 
 while being easy to port on new host CPUs. QEMU has two operating modes:
 .
  * User mode emulation: QEMU can launch Linux processes compiled for
    one CPU on another CPU.
  * Full system emulation: QEMU emulates a full system, including a
    processor and various peripherals. It enables easier testing and
    debugging of system code. It can also be used to provide virtual
    hosting of several virtual PC on a single server.
 .
 As QEMU requires no host kernel patches to run, it is very safe and
 easy to use.

Description: static libraries and headers for QEMU
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
 ARM, CRIS, i386, M68k (ColdFire), MIPS, PowerPC, SH4, SPARc and x86-64 
 emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves reasonable speed 
 while being easy to port on new host CPUs.
 .
 This package provides header files and static libraries suitable to
 emulate the various CPU supported by QEMU directly in an application.
