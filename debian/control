Description: fast processor emulator, dummy package
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator. Once upon a time there was only one
 package named `qemu', with all functionality included. These days, qemu
 become large and has been split into numerous packages. Different packages
 provides entirely different services, and it is very unlikely one will
 need all of them together. So current `qemu' package makes no sense anymore,
 and is becoming a dummy package.
 .
 If you want full system emulation of some architecture, install one or more
 of qemu-system-ARCH packages. If you want user-mode emulation, install
 qemu-user pr qemu-user-static package. If you need utilities, use qemu-utils
 package.
 .
 This package can safely be removed.

  - querying and setting guest system time
  - performing guest filesystem sync operation
  - initiating guest shutdown or suspend to ram
