qemu (0.12.3+dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with QEMU 0.12.0, KQEMU support has been removed from
  upstream, as it has not seen active development for a few years now,
  while causing regressions or limitations for non-KQEMU users.

qemu (0.10.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with QEMU 0.10.0, it is possible to control how the host
  cache is used to access block data, using the cache= suboption of the
  -drive option. The following suboptions are available:
  * none: The host page cache is entirely avoided.
  * writeback (default in QEMU 0.9.x): Writeback caching reports data
    writes as completed as soon as the data is present in the host page
    cache. This is safe as long as you trust your host. If your host 
    crashes or loses power, then the guest may experience data 
    corruption.
  * writethrough (default in QEMU 0.10.x): The host page cache is used
    to read and write data but write notification is sent to the guest 
    only when the data has been reported as written by the storage
    subsystem.

  Note that depending on your configuration (filesystem, encryption,
  kernel version, etc.), disk accesses can be very slow with the default
  cache policy (writethrough). You can use the writeback cache policy 
  instead, but the data integrity is not assured anymore.

  See qemu(1) for more details.
